- Why Genomics?
  - > 99.9% identical. Remarkable amount of diversity given small amount of changes.
  - Central dogma of biology:
    - Information flows in a signal direction from DNA -> RNA -> protein
    - Xons -> transcription -> RNA -> translation -> Protein
  - However, information *can* flow the other way
    - Proteins themselves go back and bind to the DNA itself and turn it on/off
    - Features on the DNA that are effected by the proteins
  - How do we measure mutations? DNA?
    - Sequencing has accelerated

- What is genomics?
  - Genomics is the study of genomes. The genome is the set of molecular instructions inside of your body.
  - "The branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evoluition and mapping of genomes."
  - Structure:
    - 4 base nucleotides
    - 23 Chromosome pairs, 22 are from mom/dad, + 1 X/Y (XX or YX)
  - Evolution:
    - Sequences change over evolutionary periods

- What is genomic data science?
  - Intersection of biology, stats, comp sci
  - Statistical genomics, bioinformatics
  - Start with some subjects, collect samples, prepare samples, sequence them, align reads with reference genome
  - Experimental design

- Just Enough Cell Biology
  - Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea)
    - Euks have cell nuclaei, Proks don't
  - Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. Even single-celled eukaryotes like yeast.
  - Inside a eukaryotic cells sequester Nucleus -> Chromosome -> DNA
    - Mitochondrion has its own DNA, responsible for energy metabolism
      - Perhaps an independent prokayrote 
  - Meiosis: during sexual reproduction
    - Recombination: chromosomes stick to each other, "cross over" - in humans ~1 cross over per chromosome
    - During the course of cell division, every child will get different recombinations

- Important molecules in molecular biology
  - DNA has four different nucleotides: Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine
    - Purines: A, G
    - Pyrimidines: CT
  - "Binding" in DNA means that if I know one strand I can infer the structure of the other
  - 5' (five prime) and 3' (three prime) notation for directionality
  - Another critical molecule: RNA
    - Biggest difference with RNA is no Thymine, instead: Uracil
    - Single stranded (although they can form double stranded complexes)
    - From RNA we create proteins
    - DNA is the stuff of inheritance; RNA uses a template to make proteins, but is not the stuff of inheritance
    - DNA is a "program" that we read out, which starts with RNA, which makes proteins
    - RNA translation: codons
      - Every combination of the three letters of RNA encodes an amino acid (64, 3 "stop codons")

- Human genome project
  - Department Energy Project
  - Goals: $1/base!

- From genotype to phenotype
  - Genotype: sequences of genes which determine how body functions
  - Phenotype: everything else - observable traits. Some things here are determined by genotype.
  - Mendel's pea experiment
  - Using genome sequences -> Principal Components Analysis; extract axis on which they vary the most, reduce to 2 dimensions and plot
    - Regionalization of genetic traits
