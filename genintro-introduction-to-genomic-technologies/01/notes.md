- Why Genomics?
  - > 99.9% identical. Remarkable amount of diversity given small amount of changes.
  - Central dogma of biology:
    - Information flows in a signal direction from DNA -> RNA -> protein
    - Xons -> transcription -> RNA -> translation -> Protein
  - However, information *can* flow the other way
    - Proteins themselves go back and bind to the DNA itself and turn it on/off
    - Features on the DNA that are effected by the proteins
  - How do we measure mutations? DNA?
    - Sequencing has accelerated

- What is genomics?
  - Genomics is the study of genomes. The genome is the set of molecular instructions inside of your body.
  - "The branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evoluition and mapping of genomes."
  - Structure:
    - 4 base nucleotides
    - 23 Chromosome pairs, 22 are from mom/dad, + 1 X/Y (XX or YX)
  - Evolution:
    - Sequences change over evolutionary periods

- What is genomic data science?
  - Intersection of biology, stats, comp sci
  - Statistical genomics, bioinformatics
  - Start with some subjects, collect samples, prepare samples, sequence them, align reads with reference genome
  - Experimental design
