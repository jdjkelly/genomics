# Why Care About Stats?
- Potential for personalized medical care
- Prominent case of "Genomic signatures guide the use of chemotherapeutics"
  where chemotherapy trials were started with faulty stats

# What Went Wrong?
- What went wrong with the Duke analysis?
  - Lack of transparency. Data/code weren't reproducible
  - There was a lack of cooperation
  - Silly prediction rules 
  - Study design problems
    - Batch effects (confounder)
  - Their predictions weren't locked down

# Central Dogma of Statistics
- We have a poplation, we want to take a smaller sample of that population, and
  use statistical interference to say something about the population, and in
  particular the variability of our estimate for that population
