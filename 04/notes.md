- Shortest common superstring problem
  - NP-complete
  - Idea: pick order for strings in S and construct superstring
  - Try all possible orderings and pick shortest superstring
  -  If S contains n strings, n! possible orderings

- Greedy shortest common superstring
  - Use a process of graphs, and reduction/concatenation to find shortest common substring
